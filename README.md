# islandPicker
###### An app to help you choose your next destination.

islandPicker is an original idea which arose out of the need to choose the next (Greek island)
 destination based on certain criteria.
 
The main idea is building a community, whose members will be vivid travellers, ready to explore the beauties of the greek islands.

The users will be able to rate several different aspects of the islands they have already visited.
Thus, based on the other users' ratings, the members of the community will be able to choose the perfect fit for their next holidays, based on the characteristics they enjoy the most.
 
## Technologies

Frontend will be implemented using mainly `ReactJS` and `MaterializeCSS`.

Backend will be based on `Firebase`.
